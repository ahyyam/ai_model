# Project: Zarta

Zarta is an AI-powered SaaS tool for fashion brands and e-commerce sellers to generate styled, high-quality product photos. Users upload a product image (e.g. flat lay, mockup) and a reference image (e.g. model pose, background, or aesthetic), and receive a branded photoshoot-style image matching the reference — instantly.

## Core Features

- Upload product image
- Upload style reference image
- Generate styled photos using OpenAI’s DALL·E API
- Download or view generated results
- Simple user dashboard with 3-step flow
- Authentication (signup/login)
- Usage tracking & credit management
- Pricing plans with free and paid tiers

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (no Next.js)
- **Backend/Auth**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- **Image Generation**: DALL·E via OpenAI API
- **Styling**: Black UI (#111111), white text, blue highlights
- **Prototyping**: Bubble (used for testing initial flow)

## UI Design

- Modern, minimal, premium
- Fully responsive/mobile-friendly
- Landing page is single-page (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, CTA)
- Dashboard: 3 steps (Upload Product → Upload Reference → Get Result)
- Focused on simplicity, fast UX, and branded feel

## Domain & Naming

- Using: `zarta.com` or `zarta.ai`
- Will upgrade to `.io` or other premium TLDs later if needed

## Notes

- Not limited to human models — output can be styled scenes without people
- Goal: eliminate the need for physical photoshoots for apparel/ecom visuals
- Long-term: become the go-to platform for fast, on-brand product photography using AI
